* Was done as part of Database Management course at RVCE (Fall 2019)

* Used YOLOv3 object detection model to detect vehicle drivers without helmets and stores the vehicle number in MySQL database and other driver profile details are stored in MongoDB.

* The model was tested using a real live feed from my college entrance camera and obtained an accuracy of 76%.
