-> This project was done as part of Machine Learning Course at RVCE (Aug 2019) Short answer evaluation problem solved using machine learning with Siamese LSTM networks. 
-> The intention of this project is to automate the evalution of very short answer question. This is useful in case of 1 mark questions.
-> GloVe and Universal Sentence encoder are used as embeddings here. 
-> A siamese neural network, with input to first network being the encoded student's answer and the second one being the encoded teacher's reference answer. A threshold is set and if the similarity between the student's answer and teacher's reference answer, then student's answer is marked as correct and is awarded one mark. 
-> Future improvements in consideration : To consider the question and context of the question, while evatuating the answer.
