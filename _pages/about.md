Welcome! I work as a Software Engineer-2 :computer: at [Citrix R&D](https://www.citrix.com/about/), a pivotal part of the [Cloud Software Group](https://www.cloud.com/), where I enhance the [Citrix Workspace App](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-workspace-app-for-mac.html), streamlining remote work by enabling seamless access to virtual apps and desktops. My expertise in multithreading, concurrency, and virtualization plays a crucial role in advancing our application. Beyond the development, I delve into analytics, employing machine learning algorithms to decode customer behavior. This critical analysis informs the leadership about feature engagement and guides strategic decisions, ensuring our solutions are not only innovative but also resonant with user needs.

My journey in tech has been deeply influenced by my tenure at [Samsung Research](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b) as research intern for couple of summers, where I delved into Natural Language Processing (NLP). My initial foray into NLP was with the Interaction Intelligence Team :brain:, personalizing Bixby :robot: by harnessing insights from user interactions. I further refined my skills by developing a novel on-device Hinglish detection classifier and a multilingual classifier to recognize code-switching in chats :speech_balloon: to trigger smart reply solution for a particular language, marking my first steps towards intelligent systems.

Research has been my compass since my undergraduate days, leading to multiple conference presentations and publications. During undergraduate, under the mentorship of [Dr. Deepamala](https://rvce.edu.in/cs-deepamala) and [Dr. Shobha G](https://rvce.edu.in/cs-shobhag), I co-authored three papers while working on a project that seamlessly translated natural language queries into SQL queries. My final year project, supervised by [Dr. Rajashree Shettar]() and Omkar Ramtekkar from Citrix R&D, was an academic-industry collaborative effort focused on optimizing Continuous Integration pipelines for macOS based application builds, further contributing to my publication record.

While my weekdays are dedicated to engineering at Citrix, my weekends are reserved for exploring the realm of NLP and conducting research. Lately, I've been captivated by the capabilities of large pre-trained foundation models, and I'm actively experimenting with them to create innovative applications. Currently, under the guidance of [Dr. Rajashree Shetter](https://rvce.edu.in//cs-rajashree), my research is venturing into the healthcare domain, leveraging the power of Large Language Models to address pressing challenges.

My interests lie at the confluence of Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, Intelligent Interactive Systems, and Large Language Models. I am committed to pushing the boundaries of technology to create intelligent solutions that enhance human capabilities and drive progress.

Interests: Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, Intelligent Interactive Systems, Large Language Models
